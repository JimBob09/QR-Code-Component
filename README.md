## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This is my first HTML/CSS project and so I learned the basics of HTML and CSS. Some of the most important things I learned were how to use css variables, css grid and how to use it to centre an object within it's container.

```css
.card {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: min-content;
    gap: 24px 16px;
}

body {
    display: grid;
    place-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [HTML & CSS Full Course - Beginner to Pro](https://youtu.be/G3e-cpL7ofc?si=KHk1qcmjE8X45y0u) - This helped me to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. I really liked SuperSimpleDev's teaching style and I'd recommend it to anyone wanting to learn web developement from the beginning.
